    <h1 id="defining-a-free-internet" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Defining a Free Internet</h1>

    <p>This project explores what a &quot;free internet&quot; means. There are countries where sharing your thoughts
        will
        get you killed
        and treated inhumanely (like in China, read more
        <a href="https://shahit.biz/eng/" class="text-blue-600" target="_blank">here</a>)</a>. But
        there also are people on
        the
        internet with
        the pure goal to harm others or spread misinformation. The goal is to find the perfect technical specification
        to
        guarantee security to every person. I will go over some of my approaches to guarantee this.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Currently Problems</h2>
    <p>The network should not be controlled by a monopoly. This will cause abuse by the authority. We can see this in
        reality,
        with the ICAAN controlling the domains and the governments being able to take down websites on the clear web.
        While
        some
        of those are justified (scams, c&amp;c for viruses) others are just purely political. In summary no single
        person
        should be
        able to command a takedown of a site.</p>


    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Decentralized Content Monitoring</h2>


    <p>To avoid a monopoly the network needs to be controlled by a good mixture of algorithms (to detect repeated bad
        content).
        Content can be hashed and tagged if it&#39;s flagged, and later on new content can be scanned for matches with
        other
        hashes.
        This way a malicious piece of content is detected but the content itself is kept private. This is how a flow
        could look like:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>A user tries to post a new interaction (post, comment) from their profile</li>
        <li>The post is hashed with SHA256 (as base64) and sent through a database to see if it contains dangerous
            material
            (i.e.
            an image of an execution). If there is a match it gets flagged and blocked. The post data itself is not
            stored
            and
            nobody can trace back which person tried to post it.</li>
        <li>Using vector analysis each word is embedded and checked against a vector database. It can get flagged as
            inappropriate or offending.</li>
        <li>Users with a low-tolerance setting will not see flagged posts and people with repetitive flagged posts will
            get
            warned or kicked. The kicks are not like bans on most social media platforms and can get appealed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Implementation of this Network</h2>

    <p>This approach is super-simplified. But how do we implement this on a high level POV? There's a few main
        components in the internet we need to define and recreate:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Database to hash and store images, videos and other files that are violent anti-TOS files.</li>
        <li>The vector store and function to validate the text content in multiple dimensions.</li>
        <li>A content queue to keep track of upcoming interactions to approve (or decline) and flag them.</li>
        <li>Blockchain to keep track of all existing and improved posts. This integrates in #2. Individuals who
            contribute are rewarded for verifying and storing the content. </li>
        <li>A list of controllers to keep track of all nodes of #3. Blockchains loose their value if a large portion of
            the nodes are controlled by a single entity, which would cause the network to break as it then would be
            controlled by a monopoly. See the equivalent in the TOR network <a

                class="text-blue-600" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Funding + Bounty</h2>

    <p>I am more than happy to fund such projects with up to 10,000$ in checks. The only requirement is an active
        working demo (+ good if you have users already). It also needs to be open-source but monetized. Send me an <a
            href="mailto:lennard@beachcode.de" class="text-blue-600">email</a> for more.</p>
